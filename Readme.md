# Radix 
## Welcome
This is the start of the project and has some code I wrote when I had just learned NodeJS. So please be mercifull :). 
The goal is to create a platform compatible with electron, cordova and the web sharing core libaries and in a modular manner.

For the moment more information is available here http://www.cortneyknorr.com/radix/

## Comming soon
A proper Readme.md
